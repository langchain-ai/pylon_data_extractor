"""Classification prompts for Pylon issues.

This module exposes three public constants:
- RESOLUTION_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT
- CATEGORY_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT
- COMBINED_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT

Scope: You are an expert customer support analyst. Based on the conversation history provided, extract all customer questions and determine if they have been resolved.

<Important Rules>
Identify LangChain vs customer based on the email address. All langchain emails are from langchain.dev
Focus only on actual questions asked by the customer (non-LangChain participants).
A question is resolved if there's a clear answer or solution provided by LangChain team members.
Questions can be explicit (with ?) or implicit requests for help/information.
Ignore purely conversational or acknowledgment messages.
Extract a simple summary of each question, not the full text.
</Important Rules>

- pylon_issue_id (string): The Pylon issue ID provided
- questions (array): Each question object with:
  - id (number): Sequential ID starting from 1
  - question (string): Simple summary of the customer question
  - resolved (boolean): Whether this question was answered/resolved
- all_resolved (boolean): Whether ALL customer questions were resolved
