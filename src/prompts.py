"""Classification prompts for Pylon issues.

This module exposes three public constants:
- RESOLUTION_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT
- CATEGORY_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT
- COMBINED_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT

Internally, they are composed from shared sections to keep instructions
consistent and ensure the conversation history is included only once.

# Shared sections (internal)
_SCOPE_RESOLUTION = (
    "Scope: You are an expert customer support analyst. Based on the conversation "
    "history provided, classify the resolution type for this closed support issue."

_IMPORTANT_RULES = """
<Important Rules>
Identify LangChain vs customer based on the email address. All langchain emails are from langchain.dev
Weigh the initial few messages and the last few messages higher than the middle messages.
Weigh the LangChain emails higher than the customer emails to determine resolution
Base your classification on the actual resolution described in the conversation, not just the final outcome.
If multiple issues or topics are discussed, prioritize the most important one.
</Important Rules>

_RESOLUTION_CATEGORIES = """
<Resolution Categories>
Please classify the resolution into one of these categories:
big_fix - any bug fix we need to make. Assign this tag anytime we said we released a new version for the customer to try unless it was explicitly stated as a feature request
feature_request - whenever net new functionality is acknowledged by a LangChain team member to be added or included into a new version that we released
referred_to_public_resource - there’s a doc/KB article with the answer and we can point to it. Ideally this serves as a foundation to deflect cases
referred_with_internal_knowledge - an opportunity to create new articles in the future
customer_love - general customer management activities (meetings w DE, Sales)
no_action - (Does not warrant any real repeatable work docs or process improvement or spam)
